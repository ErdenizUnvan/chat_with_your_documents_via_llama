Deploy an AI agent with RAG systems via llama_index, langchain and llama for chatting with your pdf

In order to understand how this AI Agent locally works; you must first be familiar with how local llama systems works with ollama as I explained through my previous repository: https://github.com/ErdenizUnvan/ollama_local_llama_api    

This project is one of the examples that I have made during my studies at Purdue University Applied Generative AI Specialization program.
